## 🎯 Problem Statement  
The project focuses on analyzing hotel booking data to answer:  
1️⃣ Which variables affect reservation cancellations?  
2️⃣ How can cancellations be minimized?  
3️⃣ How can hotels optimize **pricing** and **promotional strategies**?  

---

## 📖 Project Overview  
This project applies **Data Cleaning, Data Wrangling, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using **Python** libraries to uncover booking patterns, cancellation behavior, and pricing insights.  

---

## ⚙️ Steps Performed  

🔹 **Data Cleaning**  
✔ Handled missing values  
✔ Dropped irrelevant/unwanted columns  
✔ Fixed data type mismatches  

🔹 **Data Wrangling**  
✔ Filtered and grouped data for insights  
✔ Created new meaningful features  

🔹 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
✔ Visualized booking & cancellation trends  
✔ Analyzed ADR (Average Daily Rate) by status & hotel type  
✔ Identified key drivers of cancellations
